# Pokemon Image Classification with ResNet

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify Pokemon images using a ResNet.

## Project Overview
I implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on ResNet for classifying different Pokemon species. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset containing Pokemon images, which I sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from [Kaggle's Pokemon Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification). It contains images of various Pokemon species categorized for image classification tasks.

## Key Features
- Image classification using ResNet architecture.
- Preprocessing and augmentation of images to improve model generalization.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/githumster/PokemonImageClassificationWithResNet.git
